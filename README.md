# FriendsOfBabba/Core plugin for CakePHP ðŸ¥§

A rapid development plugin for CakePHP.

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

```
composer require friendsofbabba/core
bin/cake plugin load FriendsOfBabba/Core
```

Add it to your `src/Application.php` file:

```php
public function boostrap() : void
{
    // Stuff
    // Load more plugin here
    $this->addPlugin("FriendsOfBabba/Core", ['routes' => true]);
}
```

FriendsOfBabba/Core uses RESTFul API to provide access to the whole set of functionalities
exposed in to the library. We can disable `CsrfTokenProtectionMiddleware`
in `src/Application.php` because not necessary:

```php
        // ->add(new CsrfProtectionMiddleware([
        //     'httponly' => true,
        // ]));
```

Generate your private and public key necessary to work with JWT authentication:

```sh

openssl genrsa -out config/jwt.key 1024
openssl rsa -in config/jwt.key -outform PEM -pubout -out config/jwt.pem

```

Add `FriendsOfBabba/Core/Error/AppExceptionRenderer.php` to `config/app.php`:

```php
'Error' => [
    'exceptionRenderer' => 'FriendsOfBabba/Core/Error/AppExceptionRenderer',
],
```

To complete installation you have to execute this command:

```sh
bin/cake install
```

**Remember**: after first installation is always suggested to create a first migration
that will contains every table and columns that you will need. Nexts updateds
will be more easy to manage.

## API

### Hooks

You can customize specific application behaviors using `hooks`.

### Language

The plugin provides a set of language files useful to work with react-admin.
The base language file is installed when `bin/cake install` command is executed.

You can do many things with cli:

- `bin/cake langauge export`: generate a new language file based on data
  saved in to the database.
- `bin/cake language import`: import data from existing file (placed in
  root folder of the app).
- `bin/cake language clear_cache`: clear cached language files to recreate it, this
  command is useful when you change localized messages inside the database.

### Permission

The permission modules allow you to define list of permissions necessary to work
inside the application. Permissions are controller's action dependent and are always
generated scanning the controllers.

To refresh permissions:

```sh
bin/cake permission scan
```

Regenerate new list of permissions.
